How to run

1. Run py feature.py to generate the new feature vectors. You can reduce the number of features to make it go faster.
2. Run the HW1.ipynb prefereably with Anaconda default.
3. After a few minutes Training/Validation errors should be printed as well as graphs that show a scatterplot of training sample size to prediction rate.
